Several programs related to UNIX programming, these are mainly for experimental/demo purposes.

### Compiling and running
To compile and run a program, use `make {program_name}`. There is a make command for every C program. For example, you can run `make read_write` to run the read/write demo program `read_write.c`.

Use `make clean` to remove all the binary files from the `bin` folder.
