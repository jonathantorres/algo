### Compiling and running
To compile and run a program, use `make {program_name}`. There is a make command for every C program that has a `main()` function. For example, you can run `make date_cli` to run the datetime client in `src/net/date_cli.c`.

Use `make clean` to remove all the binary files from the `bin` folder.

## Running Tests
```bash
make test
```
