# Graphs
A graph library that implements a few graph algorithms:  
- Breadth First Search
- Depth First Search
- Directed/Undirected Graphs
- Weighted/Unweighted Graphs
- Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)
- Topological Sorting (DAG)
- Connected Components
- Two-Coloring
- Bipartite Graph
- Finding Cycles
- Articulated Vertices
- Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim's Algorithm)
- Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal's Algorithm)
- Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal's Union-Find Algorithm)
- Union-Find
- Shortest Path (Dijkstra)
